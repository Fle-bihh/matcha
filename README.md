Web Matcha – Full-Stack Dating App

This project is a full-stack dating platform built with React, Express, and MySQL, using TypeScript across the stack. Its main goal is not only to meet the academic requirements of my cursus but also to serve as a clean, modular, and reusable boilerplate for future real-world projects.

🎯 Project Goals

Build a production-quality architecture with frontend, backend, and database running in Docker

Ensure scalability and maintainability through strong separation of concerns and shared types

Focus on data flow, security, and modularity, not just UI polish

Provide a solid starting point for projects with authentication, matching, real-time chat, and notifications

🧩 Key Features (Planned)

Secure registration, email verification, and JWT-based authentication

User profiles with pictures, interests, fame rating, and location-based suggestions

Smart matching system with sorting/filtering

Real-time chat and notifications via WebSockets

Mobile-friendly layout with Material UI

🛠️ Tech Highlights
