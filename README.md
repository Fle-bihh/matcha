# Matcha ðŸ’•

ðŸš§ **Project in active development for 42 Porto** ðŸš§

## Introduction

Matcha is a modern dating web application developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. The project aims to create a complete dating platform that facilitates connections between users, covering the entire process from registration to final meetings.

Users can register, complete detailed profiles, browse and search for compatible matches based on location and interests, express interest through "likes", and chat with mutual matches. The application implements intelligent matching algorithms considering geographical proximity, shared interests, and user popularity ratings.
