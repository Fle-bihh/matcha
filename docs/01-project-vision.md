# 🌟 Project Vision

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is developed as part of my cursus and aims to build a **full-stack dating web application** that is both functional and architecturally solid.  
Beyond the school project requirements, it serves as a **reusable boilerplate** for future real-world applications, focusing on **clean code, modularity, and scalability**.

## 🧭 Non-Functional Goals

To ensure this project is **future-proof and professional**, the following non-functional objectives are prioritized:

### 🧩 Modularity

Each part of the system (frontend, backend, shared resources, database) is **decoupled** and easy to replace or extend.

### 📈 Scalability

Architecture supports **future growth**, including mobile apps or additional services, without major rewrites.

### 🔄 Reusability

Shared types, constants, and adapters make the codebase usable as a **starting point for new projects**.

### 🔐 Security-First Design

-   Passwords are hashed
-   Input is validated server-side
-   Vulnerabilities such as **SQL injection**, **XSS**, and **CSRF** are actively mitigated

### 🏆 Professionalism

Code, documentation, and git history are **organized and clear**, making the repository accessible to future contributors.

## 🚫 Out-of-Scope

To maintain focus on **core learning goals**, the following are explicitly excluded:

-   🎨 **Pixel-perfect UI design** or custom component styling (Material UI handles the basics)
-   🌐 **Production-grade deployment** (only a local test environment will be used)
-   🧪 **Automated testing** (although the structure will be test-ready for future use)
-   🤖 **Complex AI-based matching algorithms** (matching will be rule-based and deterministic)
-   💳 **Payment processing, subscriptions, or monetization features**
